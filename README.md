Displayr
` Introduction:

Our MVP is a homepage displaying a button, when clicked it takes the user to another page which uses google maps API to display all the busstops within a certain radius around the eda building.

As a stretch goal we will add different buttons that link to different search parameters.

Tools Needed:

Google Maps API
HTML
CSS
Handlebars
- Express

Goals:

Use APIs
Using handlebars to render google data
Use a few small, simple tests in TDD
Steps: 1. Initialize repo and install all requried tools 2. Create a few basic tests - Do we have an index page - Check we have API 3. Create a template for index 4.
